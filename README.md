# Sealambda hub

This repository holds Sealambda's engineering standards. It isn't a community
project. It's public because GitHub reads default community files only from a
public `.github` repository, and private repositories consume it without
credentials ([ADR 0002](docs/decisions/0002-public-hub-repository.md)). It
holds no secrets and no operational detail.

Sealambda repositories consume it. Each repository adopts the parts it needs
and keeps its own facts.

## What it provides

- **Community files.** `CONTRIBUTING.md`, `SECURITY.md`, `SUPPORT.md`, the
  issue forms and the pull request template. GitHub shows them in every
  repository of the organization, public or private, that has no file of its
  own ([GitHub documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/communities/setting-up-your-project-for-healthy-contributions/creating-a-default-community-health-file)).
  A repository inherits them without any step. A file of the same name in the
  repository overrides one.
- **Toolchain.** A Nix flake with pinned development shells and the
  organization's treefmt configuration, `lib.mkTreefmt`.
- **Dependency updates.** `default.json`, a shared
  [Renovate](https://docs.renovatebot.com/) preset for update timing,
  grouping and security fixes. A repository's `renovate.json` extends it and
  adds only its own managers, constraints and rules.
- **Tool configuration.** Settings for the tools that read only a file in the
  repository: EditorConfig, markdownlint-cli2, Vale and lychee. The
  `sync-config` app copies the files, and the `config-in-sync` check fails
  when a copy differs.
- **CI building blocks.** The reusable workflows `secrets.yml` (gitleaks) and
  `docs.yml` (markdownlint-cli2, lychee and Vale). A caller pins a workflow by
  its full commit SHA with the branch in a comment, for example
  `uses: sealambda/.github/.github/workflows/secrets.yml@<40-hex-sha> # main`.
  The SHA works under a policy that requires pinned actions, Renovate keeps it
  current, and the caller tests a known version
  ([how to call the workflows](docs/how-to/adopt-the-hub.md#call-the-reusable-workflows)).
