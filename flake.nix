        Builds a check that lints the Markdown files of a source tree with

        the end when any of them reports a problem, so one run shows every
        finding. The tools come from the hub's own nixpkgs, whatever nixpkgs the
        calling flake uses: the function takes only the system from `pkgs`.
        Every consumer then runs one version of each tool and of each Vale
        style, so the same page gets the same result in every repository, and a
        consumer needs no `nixpkgs.follows = "hub/nixpkgs"` for this check. A
        bump of the hub in `flake.lock` updates the tools. Where the Nix sandbox
        is enabled, which it always is on Linux CI, the check reads each tool's
        configuration from `src` and no personal configuration of the user, and
        it needs no network: lychee runs offline, the Vale styles are in the Nix
        store, and the trust store that lychee loads at startup comes from Nix
        too. The same command runs locally and in CI: `nix flake check`, or
        `nix build .#checks.<system>.docs -L`. A local re-run on an unchanged
        `src` reuses the result by the hash of `src`.

        Pass the whole `self` of the calling flake, not a set of Markdown
        files, because lychee also checks links to files that are not
        Markdown. The calling repository needs the files that `sync-config`
        writes, and the `Repository` Vale vocabulary.
