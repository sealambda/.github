# Contributing

This guide is the process guide of the Sealambda organization. It applies to
people and AI agents, in every repository that has no `CONTRIBUTING.md` of its
own. A repository adds its own commands and facts and links here.

## Commits

Each commit is one logical change. Use this form:

```text
type(scope)!: summary in the imperative

Why the change exists: the problem, and why this is the fix.

Assisted-by: <tool> (<model>)
```

- Follow
  [Conventional Commits 1.0.0](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/).
  The scope names the area. `!` marks a breaking change.
- Keep the header and each line of the body to at most 100 characters.
  commitlint refuses a longer one.
- Say why in the body. The diff shows what.
- **Sign every commit.** Use SSH signing and add the key to GitHub as a signing
  key:

  ```sh
  git config --global gpg.format ssh
  git config --global user.signingkey <path to your public key>
  git config --global commit.gpgsign true
  ```

- When an AI tool helped, add the `Assisted-by: <tool> (<model>)` trailer. Never
  add an AI as `Co-authored-by`. Do not add `Signed-off-by`.
- Write the message in the prose of
  [Writing style](https://github.com/sealambda/.github/blob/main/docs/reference/writing-style.md#commit-messages-and-pull-requests):
  commitlint and Vale check it in the `commit-msg` hook and on the pull request.
- Never use `--no-verify`. If a hook refuses a commit, fix the cause.
- Each commit passes the repository's checks.

## Pull requests

- One pull request is one change. Split a change that grows past a few hundred
  lines of written code.
- The title is a Conventional Commit, and commitlint checks it on the pull
  request. The body follows the pull request template. Both follow the prose
  rules for commit messages. The check reads the title and the body when it
  runs, so after an edit of either, re-run the `change-text` job.
- Branch names are `<type>/<topic>`, for example `fix/listen-address`.
- Update a branch by rebase. Never merge the base into it.
- Make dependent changes a stack: one pull request per layer, each on the branch
  of the layer below.

## Review and landing

- A maintainer who did not commit to the pull request approves it.
- Fix review findings with fixup commits. Fold them in before landing with
  `git rebase -i --autosquash`.
- Land with **Rebase and merge**. `main` stays linear. Nobody pushes to `main`.
- To undo a landed pull request, revert its commits in a new pull request.

## Dependencies

[Renovate](https://docs.renovatebot.com/) is the only dependency updater. Commit
lock files. Do not write update scripts.

## Documentation

Follow [Diátaxis](https://diataxis.fr/): tutorials, how-to guides, reference and
explanation are separate pages. Write short sentences in the active voice, and
use one term for one concept.

### Current state only

- A document describes what exists now. Plans and open questions are issues.
  History lives in git and in decision records.
- Delete a dead document in the pull request that makes it dead.
- A design spec (`docs/specs/`) describes work that is not built yet. The pull
  request that implements a spec moves its verified behavior into reference or
  explanation pages and its decisions into decision records. The same pull
  request opens issues for what remains and deletes the spec. Code cites the
  current pages, never a spec.
- The Vale rule `Sealambda.CurrentState` fails the `docs` check. The rule
  `Sealambda.History` shows only in an editor that runs Vale, because the check
  runs Vale with `--minAlertLevel=error`.
  [Writing style](https://github.com/sealambda/.github/blob/main/docs/reference/writing-style.md)
  defines both.

### Decision records

A decision record is a Markdown file that people write and review. No tool
validates it.
[Decision records](https://github.com/sealambda/.github/blob/main/docs/reference/decision-records.md)
defines the format of a record and of the ledger. These rules apply:

- Record only an architecturally significant decision, as a
  [MADR 4.0.0](https://adr.github.io/madr/) file named
  `docs/decisions/NNNN-slug.md`. The `status` is `proposed`, `accepted` or
  `rejected`.
- An accepted record is immutable, except for its `status`, its `date` and a
  correction that keeps the decision, such as a renamed path or a removed
  example. A correction updates `date`.
- A changed decision is a new record that restates the whole current decision.
  In the same pull request, delete the old record and list it in
  `docs/decisions/superseded.yaml` with the commit of its last text and its
  successor. In the same pull request, change each citation of the old record to
  cite the successor. The reviewer opens the permalink of the entry.
- A decision that no longer applies, with no replacement, is deleted into the
  ledger the same way, as withdrawn: its entry has no successor.
- A `rejected` record stays only while it holds reasoning that no other record
  holds.
- A record states a decision, not an inventory. A list that changes, such as
  modules, layers or owners, lives in its source of truth, a code file or a
  reference page. The record links to it.

## Agents

An agent follows this guide and these rules:

- Never push to `main`. Never merge a pull request unless a person asks. This
  rule does not cover the Renovate merge of a security fix inside the declared
  range.
- Open pull requests as drafts.
- Disclose AI help with the `Assisted-by` trailer.
- Read a repository's `AGENTS.md` for its commands.
